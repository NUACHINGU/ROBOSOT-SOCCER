# ROBOSOT - PSIS Roboteam (CREATE BY ANWAR)  
**Navigation & Mission Control System + ESP32 Robot Control Firmware**

---

## üß≠ Overview
This project consists of two integrated components developed by **PSIS Roboteam** for the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL):

1. **Navigation & Mission Control System**: A Python-based GUI application for real-time vision, mission logic, and robot communication.
2. **ESP32 Robot Control Firmware**: Low-level firmware running on an ESP32 microcontroller for motor control, IMU tracking, and command handling.

Together, these systems allow full control of a four-motor robot using real-time video and feedback from onboard sensors.

## üñ•Ô∏è Navigation & Mission Control System

### ‚úÖ Features

#### üñº GUI Interface
- Built with **Tkinter** for intuitive user interaction
- Real-time video feed with object detection overlays
- HSV color calibration tools for vision tuning
- COM port auto-detection for ESP32 connection

#### üß† Mission Modes
- **Avoidance**: Navigate around obstacles to reach the ball  
- **Goal First**: Reach the goal before interacting with the ball  
- **Keeper Mode**: Stay near the goal to block incoming shots  
- Individual PID tuning panels for each mode

#### üëÅÔ∏è Vision Processing
- Object detection using **OpenCV**
- HSV-based color segmentation
- Distance estimation based on object size and camera calibration

#### üîå Robot Communication
- Serial communication with the ESP32
- Command types: movement, grabbing, kicking, rotation, relay
- Real-time feedback from robot (e.g., yaw angle)

#### üíæ Configuration Management
- Persistent settings via `.ini` files
- Save/load configurations for color and mission logic
